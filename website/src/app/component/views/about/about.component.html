                <blockquote class="subheader">I tell my students, 'When you get these jobs that
                    you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is
                    that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power,
                    then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game.” - Toni Morrison
                </blockquote>
                <p class="about-body">As Toni Morrison said in the quote above, everybody
                    has the power and opportunity to empower others. I believe that it is
                    our duty to support and help other people who may not
                    necessarily have the means to support themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="about-body">Bringing this idea into computer science and software development,
                    I aim to use my software development skills to enrich and better the lives of people.
                    I want to utilize my skillset such that it can help streamline user experience and
                    produce impactful software to create a more sustainable environment.
                </p>
                <p class="about-body">My career interests lie in front-end software development,
                    big data, and data science. As a previous neuroscience major, I am also interested in
                    bioinformatics, genomics, and molecular biology.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="subheader">About</blockquote>
                <p class="about-body">I am currently finishing my Master's Degree in Computer Science through the
                  combined BS/MS program at CU Boulder.
                </p>
                <p class="about-body">I enjoy participating in local hackathons - I love both the competitive and
                    collaborative aspect of it. Outside of coding and school, I enjoy cooking, baking, gardening, and
                    watching documentaries and TV shows.
